# Julia REPL Tree

## Running Tests

Use `scripts/run-tests.sh` to execute the test suite with a
project-local Julia depot:

```
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

The script keeps package downloads isolated to the repository and can be
run from any shell session without affecting global Julia configuration.
